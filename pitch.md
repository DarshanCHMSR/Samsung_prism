### (Minute 0:00-1:00) Introduction: The Problem with Digital Banking Today

Good morning, judges.

Let's talk about digital banking. It's a convenience we all use, but it's far from perfect. We've all experienced the frustration: clunky interfaces, generic and unhelpful chatbots, and the constant worry about security. Is my data safe? What happens if my password is stolen?

Traditional banks are struggling to keep up. Their apps feel dated, their security measures are often limited to passwords and OTPs, and their customer support is frequently overwhelmed. This leads to a disconnected and often insecure user experience.

Today, we're here to introduce a solution that addresses these challenges head-on. A solution that is not just a banking app, but a complete, intelligent, and secure banking ecosystem.

### (Minute 1:00-3:00) Our Solution: Introducing Prism

We call it **Prism**.

Prism is a revolutionary mobile banking platform designed from the ground up to be **intelligent, secure, and intuitive**. It's a multi-layered ecosystem that combines a user-friendly mobile app with a powerful AI backend and cutting-edge security features.

At its core, Prism consists of three main components:

1.  **The Prism Mobile App:** A beautifully designed Flutter application that provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for all your banking needs.
2.  **The Prism AI Assistant:** A sophisticated multi-agent AI system, powered by Google's Gemini, that provides specialized and context-aware customer support.
3.  **Prism Secure:** A multi-layered security suite that goes beyond passwords, incorporating behavioral biometrics and location intelligence to protect our users.

Let's dive into each of these components.

### (Minute 3:00-6:00) Live Demo: The Prism Experience

#### 1. The Prism App: Banking at Your Fingertips

As you can see, the Prism app is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. It provides all the core banking features you'd expect: checking your balance, viewing transaction history, transferring funds, and even paying with a QR code. We've designed it to be fast, responsive, and a pleasure to use.

#### 2. The Prism AI Assistant: Your Personal Banker

But where Prism truly shines is with our AI assistant. This is not your average chatbot. We've developed a **multi-agent AI system** where different AI agents are specialized in different banking domains:

*   **Account Agent:** For queries about your balance and transactions.
*   **Loan Agent:** For information on loan eligibility and EMI calculations.
*   **Card Agent:** For managing your debit and credit cards.
*   **Support Agent:** For general queries and customer support.

Let's say I want to know if I'm eligible for a car loan. I can simply ask the AI assistant, "Am I eligible for a car loan?" The system routes this query to the **Loan Agent**, which processes the request and gives me a clear and accurate answer in seconds. This is the power of specialized AI.

#### 3. Prism Secure: Security You Can Trust

Now, let's talk about security. Prism employs a multi-layered security approach.

First, we have **location-based security**. You can register trusted locations, like your home or office. If a high-value transaction is initiated from an untrusted location, the system can trigger a security alert or require additional verification.

But the real innovation is our **keystroke authentication**. We use a machine learning model to analyze your unique typing rhythm and pattern. This is a form of behavioral biometrics. Even if someone steals your password, they can't replicate your typing pattern. This provides a powerful, invisible layer of security that is incredibly difficult to bypass.

### (Minute 6:00-7:00) The Technology Behind Prism

Prism is built on a modern and robust technology stack:

*   **Frontend:** The mobile app is built with **Flutter**, allowing us to have a single codebase for both Android and iOS.
*   **Backend:** Our backend services are built with **Python**, using **FastAPI** for the AI agent system and **Flask** for the keystroke authentication service.
*   **AI:** We leverage the power of the **Google Gemini API** for natural language processing and generation.
*   **Database:** We use **Firebase** for our database, authentication, and cloud storage needs, ensuring real-time data synchronization and scalability.
