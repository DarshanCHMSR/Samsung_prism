# Keystroke Password Fix Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
When keystroke detection was enabled, the password field was being cleared after recording keystroke patterns, causing an empty password to be sent to Firebase authentication, resulting in 400 Bad Request errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced KeystrokeSession Model
- Added `capturedText` field to store the typed password
- Updated `copyWith` method to include captured text

### 2. Updated KeystrokeRecorder Widget
- Modified `_stopRecording()` to capture text before clearing the field
- Preserved password value in the KeystrokeSession

### 3. Enhanced Login Screen Improvements
- Added `_capturedPassword` field to store password from keystroke session
- Updated `_onKeystrokeSessionComplete()` to capture the password
- Modified `_performTraditionalLogin()` to use captured password when keystroke detection is enabled
- Added validation for captured password (length, not empty)
- Clear captured data when toggling keystroke detection

## Test Steps

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd keystroke_auth_backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Run the Flutter App**
   ```bash
   cd samsung_prism
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

3. **Test Traditional Login (without keystroke)**
   - Enter email: testing@gmail.com
   - Enter password: testpass123
   - Keep "Enable Keystroke Verification" unchecked
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Should work normally

4. **Test Keystroke Authentication**
   - Enter email: testing@gmail.com
   - Check "Enable Keystroke Verification"
   - Enter password: testpass123 (this will be recorded and then cleared from UI)
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Should authenticate with keystroke first, then use captured password for Firebase

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Keystroke detection enabled → Password field cleared → Empty password sent to Firebase → 400 Bad Request

### After Fix:
- Keystroke detection enabled → Password captured and stored → Keystroke authentication → Stored password sent to Firebase → Successful login

## Debug Information

The system now logs:
- `DEBUG: Password captured from keystroke session: [password]`
- `DEBUG: Using captured password for Firebase auth`
- Validation checks for password presence and length

## Security Notes

- Password is temporarily stored in memory only during the authentication flow
- Password is cleared when toggling keystroke detection
- No persistent storage of passwords
- Keystroke patterns are processed separately from password text
